            <p id="five">Typing the word “lifestyle” calls to mind a carousel
                 of images: social media influencers staging the same photograph 
                 in front of a Santorini sunset, colorful dinner<br> plates shot from 
                 above, magazines dedicated to profiling the homes of the rich and
                  the famous. The concept of lifestyle is tangled up in the kind of
                   conspicuous consumption<br> that social media enables; however it also
                    undergirds major sociopolitical conversations.

                <h1>Food:</h1>
                <p id="food" onclick="myfunc()">  Anthropologists have been saying it for a while. Eating, 
                    in addition to being a physical necessity, has an unquestionable
                     cultural and ethical value. Our food preferences, but also the way we
                    choose food and keep it without wasting it, tells a 
                    lot about who we are and the values we represent</p>

            <p id="p3" onclick="myfunc2()">As society becomes more aware of each individual's special needs, techniques used in sociology and psychology are being applied to personal finance as well.

                Lifestyle financial planning considers a person's desires, dreams, strengths, needs,
                 and goals and fashions them into the overall financial equation 
                 in order to bring those goals within reach.</p>
